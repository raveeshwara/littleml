Have little fun with machine algorithms.

You may run these scripts directly at https://colab.research.google.com/ or at other similar platforms. Also, you may like to try Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) in your computer. Anaconda and PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/pycharm-anaconda/) are a good combination.

Cheers!
